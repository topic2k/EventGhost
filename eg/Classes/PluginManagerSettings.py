<p>
On the left you see the list of all plugins available for your EventGhost,
both installed and available for download. Some plugins come with your
EventGhost installation while most of them are made available via
the plugin repositories.
</p>

<p>
You can temporarily enable or disable a plugin.
To <i>enable</i> or <i>disable</i> a plugin, click its checkbox
or doubleclick its name...
</p>

<p>
Plugins showing in <span style='color:red'>red</span> are not loaded
because there is a problem. They are also listed on the 'Invalid' tab.
Click on the plugin name to see more details, or to reinstall or
uninstall this plugin.
</p>\
"""

<p>
Here you only see plugins <b>installed</b> in EventGhost.
</p>
<p>
Click on the name to see details.
</p>
<p>
Click the checkbox or doubleclick the name to <i>activate</i> or
<i>deactivate</i> the plugin.
</p>
<p>
You can change the sorting via the context menu (right click).

<p>
Here you see the list of all plugins available in the repositories, but
which are <b>not yet installed</b>.
</p>

Click on the name to see details.
</p>
<p>
You can change the sorting via the context menu (right click).
</p>
<p>
A plugin can be downloaded and installed by clicking on it's name, and
then click the 'Install plugin' button.
</p>
"""
info_upgradeable = """<h3>Upgradeable plugins</h3>

<p>
Here are <b>upgradeable plugins</b>. It means more recent versions of installed
plugins are available in the repositories.
</p>
"""
info_new = """<h3>New plugins</h3>

<p>
Here you see <b>new</b> plugins which were released
since you last visited this list.
</p>
"""
info_invalid = """<h3>Invalid plugins</h3>

<p>
Plugins in this list here are <b>broken or incompatible</b> with your
version of EventGhost.
</p>

<p>
Click on an individual plugin; if possible EventGhost shows
you more information.
</p>

<p>
The main reasons to have invalid plugins is that this plugin is not build
for this version of EventGhost. Maybe you can download another version
from <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/downloads/">www.eventghost.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another common reason is that a plugin needs some external python
libraries (dependencies). You can install them yourself, depending on
your operating system. After a correct install, the plugin should work.
